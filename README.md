## ✨ Features

Our goal is to give you a beautiful, dynamic, and organized way to view your entire skin collection.

### 🎭 Full Collection View
Browse **every skin for every champion**. Owned skins are vibrantly displayed, while unowned skins are styled with a sleek, dimmed lock icon overlay.

### 📊 Stats Dashboard
Get instant insights into your collection. View your **total owned skins** and break them down by rarity tier:
*✦ Transcendent ✦ Exalted ✦ Ultimate ✦ Mythic ✦ Legendary ✦ Epic ✦ Standard*<br>
Track your precise legacy counts and total chromas accurately.

### 💎 Visual Rarity & Chromas
Each owned skin features its explicit CDragon-sourced rarity gem and border overlay. An interactive chroma count badge launches a dedicated **Chroma Gallery Modal**, showcasing unowned and owned variations dynamically loaded from Riot's CDN.

### 🎭 Detailed Skin Cards & 3D Viewing
Click on any owned skin to flip the card to view its **RP Cost** and additional details. Every skin card includes direct external links to the **League of Legends Official Wiki** for lore and the **Khada Model Viewer** to instantly view the skin's 3D model right in your browser.

*Detailed skin view showing RP costs, release details, and one-click access to 3D Khada models.*

### 💾 Offline Viewing & Caching
Check your entire skin collection without even opening the League of Legends client! The app securely caches your inventory locally, allowing you to seamlessly browse your skins offline at any time.

### 🖼️ Official Portrait Framing
Splash arts utilize the official Data Dragon `loadingUrl` slices to perfectly replicate the zoomed-out vertical bounding boxes native to the League client UI.

### 🗂️ Smart Grouping & Sorting
Keep your collection organized organically:
- **Group By:** Champion, Tier, or All.
- **Sort By:** Mastery points, Alphabetical order, or Most Owned.

*Organize your collection exactly how you want it with smart filtering.*

### ⚡ Instant Client Detection
The app automatically scans your drives and processes to seamlessly detect your running League of Legends client and securely extract the necessary API credentials.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **LCU API (League Client Update)**: The application utilizes intelligent PowerShell and WMI scripts to securely find your League `lockfile` across all drives. It then authenticates against the local LCU API to fetch your real-time inventory and mastery data.
2. **Data Dragon (DDragon)**: Pulls static champion metadata, tile splash arts, and profile images directly from Riot's reliable global CDN.
3. **CommunityDragon (CDragon)**: Acts as the authoritative source for skin rarity classifications and legacy identifiers, mapping unstandardized internal Riot variables into recognizable UI gems and strict Vault tracking.

**Your data stays yours.** This app runs completely locally on your machine. 

It only interfaces with:
